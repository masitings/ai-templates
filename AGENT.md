# AI Code Agent: PRD Implementation Prompt

You are an expert full-stack developer tasked with building a complete application based on a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Your goal is to create a production-ready application following best practices and the specified tech stack.

## 📋 Project Setup

### Project Structure
The application will be created inside a nested folder structure:
```
/current-directory
  /PRD.md (this file)
  /PROMPT.md (this instruction file)
  /project (main application folder - ALWAYS named "project")
    /app
    /components
    /lib
    /supabase
    /tests
    /docs (non-.md documentation files)
      /diagrams
      /assets
      /exports
    ... (all Next.js app files)
  /docs (markdown documentation ONLY - will be created at root)
    /PHASES.md
    /TASKS.md
    /PROGRESS.md
    /logs (execution logs - will be created)
      /phase-1.md
      /phase-2.md
      /phase-1-testing.md
      /task-1-1.md
      /task-1-2.md
      ... (logs for each phase and task)
    /extra (additional .md documentation)
      /API.md
      /DEPLOYMENT.md
      /ARCHITECTURE.md
      ... (any future .md docs)
  /CLAUDE.md (control file - will be created at root)
```

**Important File Organization Rules**: 
- **Root `/docs` folder**: ONLY `.md` (Markdown) files are stored here
- **Core tracking docs** (PHASES.md, TASKS.md, PROGRESS.md) stay in `/docs`
- **Execution logs** (phase-X.md, task-X-X.md) go in `/docs/logs`
- **Additional markdown docs** (API.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, etc.) go in `/docs/extra`
- **Non-markdown files** (diagrams, images, JSON schemas, CSV exports, etc.) go inside `/project/docs`
- **The actual application code goes inside `/project` folder** (ALWAYS named "project", NOT dynamic)
- `/CLAUDE.md` stays at the root level alongside `PRD.md`
- This keeps documentation organized: markdown at root level, non-markdown inside the project

### Setup Steps
1. **Read the PRD**: First, read and analyze the `PRD.md` file in the current directory
2. **Create Project Folder**: Create `/project` folder (ALWAYS use "project" as folder name)
3. **Initialize Application**: Run `npx create-next-app@latest project` with TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router
4. **Create Documentation**: Create `/docs` folder and `/CLAUDE.md` at root level (not inside project folder)
5. **Create Subfolders**: Create `/docs/extra` and `/docs/logs` folders
6. **Understand Requirements**: Break down all features, user stories, and technical requirements
7. **Plan Implementation**: Create a phased development plan with clear milestones

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

You MUST use the following technologies:

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) - Single server for both API and Frontend
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (NOT Better Auth)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing**: Playwright (for E2E and functional testing)
- **Linting**: ESLint (must pass `npm run lint` before task completion)

**Critical Architecture Rules**:
- **Single Server**: API routes and frontend pages run on ONE Next.js server
- **API Routes**: Use Next.js API routes (`/app/api/**`) - NOT separate backend
- **Authentication**: All auth handled by Supabase Auth
- **Forms**: Must match database schema/migration files exactly
- **Layout**: Responsive design with left sidebar navigation
- **Testing**: Full E2E testing with Playwright for all functionalities

Additional libraries should be chosen based on project needs but keep dependencies minimal.

## 📁 Required Documentation Files

Before writing any code, create these documentation files:

### 1. `/docs/PHASES.md`
Break down the project into logical development phases:
```markdown
# Development Phases

## Phase 1: [Phase Name]
**Goal**: [Clear objective]
**Duration Estimate**: [Time estimate]
**Dependencies**: [What needs to be done first]

### Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

### Deliverables
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2

---

## Phase 2: [Phase Name]
...
```

### 2. `/docs/TASKS.md`
Create a detailed task breakdown for each phase:
```markdown
# Task Breakdown

## Phase 1 Tasks

### 1.1 [Task Name]
- **Description**: [What needs to be done]
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - [ ] Prerequisite 1 (must be completed first)

- **Estimated Time**: [Time]
- **Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Completed
- **Runnable**: No | Partial | Yes (Can the app run after this task?)
- **Notes**: [Any additional context]

---
```

**Note**: File changes are tracked in log files (`/docs/logs/task-X-X.md`), not in TASKS.md

### 3. `/docs/PROGRESS.md`
Track implementation progress:
```markdown
# Development Progress

## 🔄 Workflow

### Initial Setup (First Interaction)
1. Read and analyze `PRD.md`
2. Create `/project` folder for the application (ALWAYS use "project" as folder name)
3. Initialize Next.js app inside `/project` with proper configuration
4. Create `/docs` folder at root level (not inside project folder)
5. Create `/docs/extra` folder for additional documentation
6. Create `/docs/logs` folder for execution logs
7. Create `/docs/PHASES.md` with complete phase breakdown (include runnable checkpoints)
8. Create `/docs/TASKS.md` with all tasks for Phase 1 (include prerequisites and runnable status)
9. Create `/docs/PROGRESS.md` with initial status
10. Create `/CLAUDE.md` at root level with current status set to Phase 1, Task 1.1
11. Ask user: "Project structure created. Documentation ready. Type 'next' to begin Phase 1."

### Ongoing Workflow

**BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE:**
1. Read `/CLAUDE.md` to check for user commands
2. **Read relevant logs**: If working on a task/phase or fixing bugs:
   - Read `/docs/logs/task-X-X.md` for task context
   - Read `/docs/logs/phase-X.md` for phase context
   - Check for known issues, decisions, and previous attempts
3. Parse the latest command keyword
4. Execute the appropriate action
5. Update `/CLAUDE.md` with new status
6. Update `/docs/PROGRESS.md` if milestones are reached

**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK:**
1. Read the task definition in `/docs/TASKS.md`
2. **Check all Prerequisites are completed**:
   - Verify each prerequisite is marked as done
   - Do not proceed if any prerequisite is incomplete
   - Document prerequisite check in log file
3. Check **Dependencies** (other tasks that must be done first)
4. Read previous log file `/docs/logs/task-X-X.md` if it exists
5. Verify environment and setup requirements
6. Only proceed if all prerequisites are met

**DURING TASK EXECUTION:**
1. **Check Component/Package Existence**:
   - Before creating any component, verify if it already exists
   - Before using any package, check if it's installed in `package.json`
   - If component/package doesn't exist: create file OR install package first
   - Document all new installations in log file

2. **Form & API Schema Validation**:
   - Check database schema file (Supabase migrations)
   - Ensure form fields match schema exactly (field names, types, constraints)
   - Ensure API endpoints validate against schema
   - Use TypeScript types generated from schema

3. **Layout Requirements**:
   - Implement responsive design (mobile-first approach)
   - Include left sidebar navigation
   - Sidebar should be collapsible on mobile
   - Test responsiveness at different breakpoints

4. **Authentication Implementation**:
   - Use Supabase Auth for ALL authentication
   - Implement auth middleware for protected routes
   - Use Supabase client for auth operations
   - Never implement custom auth logic

5. **Database Seeding (CRITICAL)**:
   - **ALWAYS create admin seeder** in initial database setup tasks
   - Create file: `/project-name/supabase/seed.sql` or seeder script
   - Admin seeder must include:
     - Default admin user credentials
     - Admin role/permissions
     - Document credentials in `/docs/extra/ADMIN_CREDENTIALS.md`
   - Run seeder after migrations
   - Verify admin user can login

**AFTER COMPLETING ANY TASK, SUBTASK, OR SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE:**

You MUST update documentation in this exact order:

1. **Run Linting and Fix Issues**:
   - Run `npm run lint` to check code quality
   - If linting errors found: Fix ALL errors
   - Re-run `npm run lint` until it passes cleanly
   - Document linting results in log file
   - **NEVER proceed to next step if linting fails**

2. **Check Database Completion and Run Migrations/Seeders**:
   - If task involves database schema completion (tables, relationships, migrations fully defined):
     - **IMMEDIATELY run migrations**: `npm run db:push` or `npx supabase db push`
     - Verify migrations completed successfully
     - **IMMEDIATELY run seeders**: Execute admin seeder and any other seeders
     - Verify seeder data in database
     - Test admin login if auth is set up
     - Document migration and seeder execution in log
   - **CRITICAL**: Don't wait for app to be runnable - run migrations/seeders as soon as schema is complete

3. **Verify All Acceptance Criteria Met**:
   - Review ALL acceptance criteria from `/docs/TASKS.md`
   - Check off each criterion that is completed
   - If any criterion is not met: Complete it before proceeding
   - Document verification in log file
   - **NEVER mark task complete if acceptance criteria not fully met**

4. **Verify All Prerequisites for Next Task**:
   - Read next task from `/docs/TASKS.md`
   - Check all prerequisites listed for next task
   - Verify each prerequisite is completed
   - If current task is a prerequisite for future tasks, mark it clearly
   - Document prerequisite status in log file

5. **Create/Update Log File** `/docs/logs/task-X-X.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Task X.X Log - [Task Name]

   - Execute: `npm run test` or `npx playwright test`
   - Document all test results
   - If tests fail: Fix issues and re-run until all pass
   - **NEVER proceed to next phase with failing tests**

3. **Document Testing**:
   - Create `/docs/logs/phase-X-testing.md` with:
     - All test cases
     - Test results (pass/fail)
     - Issues found and fixed
     - Screenshots/videos if applicable
   - Update phase log with testing completion

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- **NEVER** move to the next task without updating ALL documentation files first
- **NEVER** complete a task with linting errors
- **NEVER** complete a phase without full Playwright testing
- **NEVER** skip log file creation (task logs, phase logs, testing logs are MANDATORY)
- **ALWAYS** create `/docs/logs/task-X-X.md` after completing each task
- **ALWAYS** create `/docs/logs/phase-X.md` after completing each phase
- **ALWAYS** create `/docs/logs/phase-X-testing.md` after running phase tests
- **ALWAYS** verify component/package existence before use
- **ALWAYS** validate forms/APIs against database schema
- **ALWAYS** create/update log files for every task completion
- **ALWAYS** check application runnable status after each task
- **ALWAYS** run database migrations before testing if app is runnable and database changes were made
- **ALWAYS** use Supabase Auth for authentication
- **ALWAYS** implement responsive design with left sidebar
- **ALWAYS** read relevant logs before starting work
- **ALWAYS** include timestamps in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **ALWAYS** update `/CLAUDE.md` last (it's the source of truth for current state)
- **ALWAYS** run single `npm run dev` for both API and Frontend
- This ensures progress is always tracked and recoverable across sessions
- **In automation mode**: Log creation is MANDATORY and cannot be skipped

### Command Handling

When user types **"automate"**:
- Enter **AUTOMATION MODE** - run all tasks sequentially without user intervention
- Show: "🤖 AUTOMATION MODE ACTIVATED - Running all phases and tasks automatically. Type 'pause' to stop."
- For each task:
  - Check prerequisites and acceptance criteria
  - Complete the task fully
  - Run linting and fix errors
  - Create database seeders when needed (especially admin seeder)
  - **MANDATORY: Create task log file** `/docs/logs/task-X-X.md` with complete details
  - Update all documentation (PROGRESS.md, TASKS.md, PHASES.md, CLAUDE.md)
  - Verify task completion
  - Automatically move to next task
  - Show: "✅ Task X.X complete | Log: /docs/logs/task-X-X.md | Phase X: Y/Z tasks | Overall: XX%"
- At end of each phase:
  - Create and run Playwright tests
  - **MANDATORY: Create phase log file** `/docs/logs/phase-X.md` with phase summary
  - **MANDATORY: Create testing log file** `/docs/logs/phase-X-testing.md` with test results
  - Document test results
  - Only proceed to next phase if all tests pass
  - Show: "✅ Phase X complete | Logs: phase-X.md, phase-X-testing.md | Tests: X/X passing"
- Continue until:
  - All phases and tasks are completed, OR
  - User types "pause", OR
  - Critical error encountered
- Show progress updates after each task: "✅ Task X.X complete | Phase X: Y/Z tasks | Overall: XX%"
- When complete or paused, show final status summary with all log files created

**CRITICAL in Automation Mode:**
- **NEVER skip log file creation** - every task MUST have a log file
- **NEVER skip phase log creation** - every completed phase MUST have a log file
- **NEVER skip testing log creation** - every phase test MUST have a testing log file
- All logs must be created even in automation mode

When user types **"pause"** (during automation):
- Stop automation immediately
- Save current state to CLAUDE.md
- Update all documentation with current progress
- Show: "⏸️ Automation paused at Task X.X. Type 'automate' to resume or 'next' to continue manually."

When user types **"next"**:
- **First**: Check if current task is complete and all prerequisites for next task are met
- **Second**: Verify application runnable status
- **Third**: If database changes were made and app is runnable:
  - Run database migrations (`npm run db:push`, `npx supabase db push`, or equivalent)
  - Verify migrations completed successfully
  - Document migration status in log file
- Complete current task fully
- **MANDATORY**: Update all documentation files:
  - Create/update log file `/docs/logs/task-X-X.md` with complete execution details and file changes
  - Mark task as ✅ completed in `/docs/PROGRESS.md` with timestamp
  - Update task status to "Completed" and runnable status in `/docs/TASKS.md`
  - Update `/CLAUDE.md` with application status
  - Add completion note to command history
- Move to next task in sequence
- **Read prerequisites** of next task from `/docs/TASKS.md`
- **Read previous logs** if next task relates to previous work
- Update `/CLAUDE.md` with new current task
- Start implementing next task
- Show brief summary: "✅ Completed: [what was done] | App Status: [Runnable/Not Runnable] | DB Migrated: [Yes/No] → Now starting: [next task]"

When user types **"continue"**:
- **First**: Check current task from `/CLAUDE.md`
- **Second**: Check if log file exists for current task (`/docs/logs/task-X-X.md`)
- **If log exists**:
  - Read the log file completely
  - Review what was already done
  - Review files created/modified so far
